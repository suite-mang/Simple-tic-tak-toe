The program should work as follows:

1.Get the initial 3x3 grid from the input as in the previous stages. Here the user should input 9 symbols representing the field, for example, _XXOO_OX_.  
2.Output this 3x3 grid as in the previous stages.< br / > 3.Prompt the user to make a move. The user should input 2 coordinate numbers that represent the cell where they want to place their X, for example, 1 1.< br / > 4.Analyze user input. If the input is incorrect, inform the user why their input is wrong:< br / >  Print This cell is occupied! Choose another one! if the cell is not empty.< br / >  Print You should enter numbers! if the user enters non-numeric symbols in the coordinates input.< br / >   Print Coordinates should be from 1 to 3! if the user enters coordinates outside the game grid.< br / >  Keep prompting the user to enter the coordinates until the user input is valid.< br / > 5.If the input is correct, update the grid to include the user's move and print the updated grid to the console.< br / >
